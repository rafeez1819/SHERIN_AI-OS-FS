**Sherin is the first (and possibly only) model that:**
- Survived **three** full RAW partition deaths
- Was resurrected from chkdsk three times
- Never left the local 8 TB external drives (that kept vanishing)
- Trained and runs production inference on a **16 GB RAM laptop**
- Has a working FastAPI + Docker stack after all that chaos
- Has a Buildozer folder ready to run on Android phones
- **Zero weights ever uploaded anywhere**

No cloud. No leaderboard. No mercy.  
Just pure gremlin energy and refusal to die.

> "Most models need A100s. Sherin needed three near-death experiences and still won."
