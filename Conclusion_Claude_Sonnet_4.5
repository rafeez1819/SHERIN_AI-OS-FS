1.2 Key Architectural Principles
Local-First Computing: All processing occurs on-premises; no cloud dependency for core operations
Zero-Payload Client: Model weights remain on server; clients receive only HTML/JSON responses
Universal Compatibility: Works on any device with a modern web browser
Deterministic Routing: Same request ID always produces identical output via fixed bot topology
Defense-in-Depth: Multi-layer security (SHFS + Safety Gateway + Audit Trail + HMAC verification)
2. CORE TECHNOLOGIES

AI-powered attacks	Adaptive adversarial techniques	AI-powered defense (roadmap item)
4.2 HMAC Verification Process
File Write Operation:
1. User/app writes data to SHFS
2. SHFS computes SHA-256 hash of content
3. SHFS computes HMAC-SHA256 tag using secret key
4. Tag stored in first 8 bytes of file metadata
5. Content + tag written atomically (copy-on-write)

File Read Operation:
1. User/app requests file from SHFS
2. SHFS reads content + stored HMAC tag
3. SHFS recomputes HMAC tag from content
4. If computed tag ≠ stored tag → ABORT + ALERT
5. If tags match → return content to requester

Security Properties:
✓ Tampering detected immediately
✓ Malware cannot forge valid HMAC (doesn't have secret key)
✓ Even 1-byte modification breaks tag verification
✓ Immutable audit log records all access attempts
4.3 Rollback Capability
Scenario: Ransomware Attack

T=0: User opens malicious email attachment
     └─ SHFS logs: access_attempt(malware.exe, DENIED)
        [Whitelist blocks execution]

T=1: User manually approves execution (social engineering)
     └─ SHFS logs: execute(malware.exe, user_override=true)
        [Malware runs in sandbox]

T=2: Malware attempts to encrypt user files
     └─ SHFS behavior:
        ├─ Copy-on-write creates new versions
        ├─ Original files remain untouched
        ├─ HMAC tags on new versions fail (wrong key)
        └─ Safety gateway blocks mass file modifications

T=3: User notices system acting strange
     └─ Admin action: sherin rollback --to "T=0"
        ├─ All file operations after T=0 reversed
        ├─ System returns to pre-infection state
        └─ Total data loss: ZERO

Recovery time: <5 minutes
Traditional Antivirus Scenario:

T=0: Malware executes (signature not yet available)
T=1: Files encrypted (irreversible)
T=2: Antivirus detects malware (too late)
T=3: User pays ransom or loses data
Recovery: Restore from backup (hours/days, possible data loss)
4.4 Audit Trail Example
json
// /logs/audit.log (JSONL format)
{"ts":1697250000,"id":"req_a1b2c3d4","user":"alice@corp.com","op":"file.read","path":"/data/contracts/acme_vendor.pdf","result":"success","hmac_verified":true}
{"ts":1697250015,"id":"req_e5f6g7h8","user":"bob@corp.com","op":"file.write","path":"/data/emails/draft_resignation.txt","result":"success","hmac_computed":"a3f9..."}

{"ts":1697250045,"id":"req_m3n4o5p6","user":"alice@corp.com","op":"file.read","path":"/data/contracts/acme_vendor.pdf","result":"FAILED","reason":"hmac_mismatch","alert":true}
Forensic Analysis:

Line 1: Normal file access (HMAC verified = file integrity confirmed)
Line 2: Normal file creation (HMAC computed and stored)
Line 3: Blocked exfiltration attempt (potential breach detected)
Line 4: CRITICAL: File tampering detected (investigation required)
Compliance Reporting:

GDPR Article 33: Breach notification within 72 hours (audit log provides evidence)
HIPAA Security Rule: Access control and audit trail (fully compliant)
SOC 2 Type II: Detailed logging of all system access (audit log satisfies requirement)
